Create a Formula Field that Returns a Number
Create a formula field that calculates the volume of a cylinder, rounded to the nearest whole number. Use radius, height, and Ï€ (the constant Pi = 3.14), like this:
3.14 x (radius x radius) x height

Note: Although this formula field might best be created on a custom object, for simplicity, you create this formula on the Opportunity object.
Create custom fields to use in a formula field:
Create a custom field:
Object: Opportunity
Type: Number
Field Label: Radius
Field Name: Radius
Create another custom field:
Object: Opportunity
Type: Number
Field Label: Height
Field Name: Height
Create a formula field:
Object: Opportunity
Type: Formula
Field Label: Cylinder Volume
Field Name: Cylinder_Volume
Formula Return Type: Number
Decimal Places: 0
Use the Radius field in the formula
Use the Height field in the formula
Use 3.14 for the value of Pi

FORMULA: 

ROUND (3.14 * Radius__c *  Radius__c * Height__c ,0)
